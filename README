This is a scratch OS through which I plan to learn about operating
systems. I do not plan to make it useful. It may turn out to be a
stepping stone to a more sophisticated and well designed OS. Keep your
eyes out for that.

Thanks to Dhruv Matani <dhruvbird@gmx.net> for testing this software
so patiently.
