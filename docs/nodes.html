<a name="introduction"></a><h3>Introduction </h3>
<p> Nodes is an operating system kernel which is being developed by
      me, Apurva Mehta, as an effort to get some practical experience with
      operating system development. I am a 20 year old Computer
      Engineering student in Mumbai, India. </p>

<p> The name <b>Nodes</b> stands for <b>NO DES</b>ign. Basically I am
writing it to get familiar with my IA-32 machine, with the GNU
development tools and with operating system development concepts. The
ultimate goal is to write an operating system which is
      <i>mathematically</i> correct. I believe that programming is a
      scientific discipline and my hope is to write an operating
      system in that spirit. Nodes is just a stepping stone toward
      that goal. I continue to research the math needed in
      accomplishing that goal while Nodes is being written.</p>

<a name="design"></a><h3>Design</h3> 
<p>When I explained the meaning of the name, I really
meant what I said. There has been absolutely no design process
involved in the construction of Nodes. </p>

<p> There are two things that you might find helpful if you want to
      have a look at the Nodes source code.
<ol>
<li> Nodes is a monolithic kernel.
<li> The source code layout is modelled on that of Linux.
</ol>
</p>

<a name="future"></a><h3>Future Plans</h3>
<p> I do not intend Nodes to be a UNIX clone. As a result of this
      decision, I have no System Call Interface in mind at the moment.
      I do not think there will ever be such a formal specification for
      Nodes. I think that I will be the only one writing programs for
      Nodes and those programs will exist purely to test the
      capability of the kernel. Not to make it useful. </p>

<p> However, There are a lot of things I want to do with Nodes before I move on:
<ul>
<li> A memory management infrastructure which allows for paging and
	virtual memory.
<li> A task management infrastructure. 
<li> A disk driver
<li> A terminal driver
</ul>
</p>

<p> If you also believe that programming is a scientific discipline
      and want to help me design and build an OS which can be
      mathematically proven to work, then please get in touch with me. My
      inspiration is Edsger Dijkstra and I find his papers an
      invaluable source of information. You can find many of his
      papers online <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/">here
	</a>. </p>
<p> If you have no OS development experience and want to get started,
      then you will find that Nodes is so small that it is easy to understand. </p>

<a name="current"></a><h3>Current Status</h3>
<p> Currently, Nodes has the following features:
<ul>
<li> A keyboard driver.
<li> An interrupt handling infrastructure capable of handling shared
	IRQ lines.
</ul>
</p>

<a name="devenv"></a><h3> Development environment </h3>

<p>The programming language for Nodes is ANSI C. x86 assembly is used only
      when there is no way doing a particular thing in C. </p>

<p> The GNU development tools are the tools of choice for developing
      Nodes. These include :
<ul>
<li> <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/">The GNU C compiler</a> (3.2.2)
<li> <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/binutils"> The GNU Assembler </a>(2.13.9)
<li> <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/make">GNU Make </a>(3.79.1)
<li> <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gnu-arch/"> GNU Arch </a>(1.1)
<li> <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/binutils">The GNU Linker </a>(2.13.9)
</ul>
 </p>

<a name="getting"></a><h3> Getting Nodes </h3>
<p> You can download Nodes from the following locations:
<ul>
<li> <a href="files/nodes-0.01.tar.bz2">
	 http://nodes.50g.com/files/nodes-0.01.tar.bz2
	</a>
</ul>
</p>

<p> Nodes uses GNU Grub as its bootloader. If you do not already have
Grub installed, you can get it from <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/software/grub">here</a>. Alternatively, I
have prepared a bootable floppy image which contains GNU Grub as well
as Nodes. You can download this image <a
href="files/nodes.img.bz2">here</a>. You must first uncompress this
      image and then write it straight to a floppy. On UNIX systems,
      you can use dd, on Windows Systems rawrite is available.</p>
